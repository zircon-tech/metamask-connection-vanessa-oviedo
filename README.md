2) Once the wallet is connected, you can interact with the contract with address: 0x4e1b0353157700252f95b5C20D990f4a3bA71760 
See: https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0x4e1b0353157700252f95b5c20d990f4a3ba71760 

3) You can also add a new person to the Contract and also Recover existing data by index.
